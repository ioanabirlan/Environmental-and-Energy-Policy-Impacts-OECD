# Environmental and Energy Metrics Dataset (2000-2019)



This dataset provides comprehensive panel data (2000-2019) on various environmental and energy metrics across two regions (Europe and America) with a focus on indicators that influence CO2 emissions. It includes data from **OECD statistics** and covers variables that serve as indicators of **smart urban development** and **governmental policies**.

## About the Dataset

Researchers and policymakers can use this dataset to analyze the impact of various factors on CO2 emissions and to compare the effectiveness of environmental policies between **OECD countries** in Europe and America. The dataset is valuable for exploring significant differences and similarities in environmental and energy policies, municipal waste management, renewable energy adoption, and technology development.

### Key Variables:
- **Production-based CO2 emissions**
- **Total primary energy supply**
- **Renewable energy supply (% of total energy supply)**
- **Municipal waste recycled or composted (% of treated waste)**
- **Mortality from exposure to ambient PM2.5**
- **Welfare costs of premature mortalities from exposure to ambient PM2.5**
- **Development of environment-related technologies (% of all technologies)**
- **Relative advantage in environment-related technology**
- **Environmentally related taxes (% of GDP)**
- **Terrestrial protected area (% of land area)**
- **Population density (inhabitants per kmÂ²)**

## Usage

This dataset is ideal for analyzing the **determinants of CO2 emissions** and understanding the effectiveness of different environmental policies. Users can explore:

- The relationship between renewable energy supply and CO2 emissions.
- Comparative analysis of CO2 emissions across OECD countries in Europe and America.
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of environmental policies and their economic implications.
- Assessment of the role of renewable energy and technology development in reducing emissions.
- Exploration of smart urban development indicators and their impact.
- The impact of municipal waste management practices on environmental outcomes.
- Differences in environmental technology development between European and American OECD countries.
- The influence of population density and urban development on CO2 emissions.

## Analytical Opportunities

This dataset opens up possibilities for advanced statistical analysis and forecasting:
- **Statistical tests**: Analyze significant differences between the two regions.
- **Forecasting emissions**: Apply time series analysis to forecast future emissions for both regions.
- **Scenario analysis**: Conduct **Monte Carlo Simulations** to test different policy outcomes and environmental scenarios.

## Source

The data is sourced from **OECD Statistics**, providing credible and comprehensive environmental metrics across a broad range of OECD countries.
